# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis.

 Throughout this project Bobby was asked to do two major tasks after learning SQL. First, he was to look at and determine the number of reiring employees per title. Secondly, Bobby was asked to identify the employees who are eligible to partcicpate in a mentorship program. Bobby wants to be able to prepare his manager for what he is calling, the "silver tsuami". This refers to a lot of current employees reaching retirement age. 

## Results
- First, we want to look at what the overall percent of employees who are eligible to retire. We first see that there are 300,024 total employees and out of that 72,458 employees are eligible for retirement. This means that 24% of the workforce could all retire at the same point. This is something major that the company will need to keep an eye on. This is a good thing that we looked at the number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
- When we are looking at a high number of employees who are eligible for retirement, we want to see how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program. With the 300,024 employees that are currently working, we can see that there are 1941 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This would equal out to about .6% of employees. 
- After looking at the total numbers of employees that will be eligible to retire, we will want to look at how the different titles will be effected. Below will breakdown each title.

- When we look at this data, we can see that there are two significant areas that will be effected, engineering and staff. We can see that almost half of the employees who are eligible for retirement will be from either the Senior Engineer title or the Engineer title, 48.58%. Following the Engineer titles, we can see that 44.94% will be eligible from either the Senior Staff title or the Staff title.

## Summary
When we are looking at the overall impact of the "silver tsunami" we can see that this will leave 72,458 spots open and ready to be filled. Unfortunately, with such a high number, that will leave the company unable to mentor the next generation. Out of the 72,458 employees who are eligible for retirement, only .6% are able to mentor. This will leave a huge gap at the company when the "silver tsunami" hits.
